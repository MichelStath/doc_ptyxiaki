1. **ConstraintLayout**: This is the root layout that allows for flexible positioning of its children.
    
2. **RecyclerView** (`@+id/recyclerView`):
    
    - Displays a list of contacts vertically.
    - It has constraints to match the parent's width, start and end edges, and the top edge, leaving space for the ActionBar.
    - Its height is set to `600dp`.
3. **Button** (`@+id/button3`):
    
    - Represents the button used to add a new contact.
    - It triggers the `addNewContact` method when clicked.
    - Constrained to be horizontally centered (`layout_constraintHorizontal_bias="0.497"`) and below the RecyclerView.

**Constraints**:

- The RecyclerView is constrained to match the parent's width and be anchored to the top of the parent, allowing it to take up the available space below the ActionBar.
- The Button is constrained to be horizontally centered and placed below the RecyclerView, leaving a small margin between them.

**Attributes**:

- Various attributes such as `layout_width`, `layout_height`, `onClick`, `text`, etc., are specified to define the appearance and behavior of the UI components.

Overall, this layout provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to view a list of fast contacts and add new contacts easily.
