1. **ConstraintLayout**: This is the root layout that allows for flexible positioning of its children.
    
2. **RecyclerView** (`@+id/recyclerView1`):
    
    - Displays a list of messages vertically.
    - It has constraints to match the parent's width, start and end edges, and the top edge, leaving space for the ActionBar.
    - Its height is set to `655dp`.
3. **Button** (`@+id/button5`):
    
    - Represents the button used to add a new message.
    - It triggers the `addNewMessage` method when clicked.
    - Constrained to be horizontally centered (`layout_constraintHorizontal_bias="0.498"`) and at the bottom of the parent.

**Constraints**:

- The RecyclerView is constrained to match the parent's width and be anchored to the top of the parent, allowing it to take up the available space below the ActionBar.
- The Button is constrained to be horizontally centered and placed at the bottom of the parent.

**Attributes**:

- Various attributes such as `layout_width`, `layout_height`, `onClick`, `text`, etc., are specified to define the appearance and behavior of the UI components.

Overall, this layout provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to view a list of fast messages and add new messages easily.
